# **Synthetic Data Generator**

Welcome to the **Synthetic Data Generator** project! üéâ This project showcases how to create synthetic datasets using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** in Python. It‚Äôs a privacy-preserving approach to data generation, ideal for various real-world applications like data augmentation and simulations.

## **Overview**

Synthetic data is artificially generated to mimic real-world datasets, ensuring the statistical properties and feature relationships of the original data. This project trains a GAN model on app usage data to produce high-quality synthetic samples. The goal is to generate realistic datasets while safeguarding user privacy, making it a robust solution for research, testing, and analysis.

## **Features**
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Generates data without exposing sensitive information.
- **GAN-Based Approach**: Leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks for realistic data generation.
- **Real-World Application**: Uses a dataset of daily app usage patterns.
- **Python Implementation**: Simple and modular code for easy understanding and customization.

---

## **Use Cases**
- **Data Augmentation**: Enrich datasets for machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Privacy-Preserving Analysis**: Safeguard user privacy while sharing realistic data insights.
- **Simulations and Testing**: Create artificial datasets for testing and experimentation.

## **How It Works**
1. **Dataset Preparation**: A real-world dataset is used as input, containing app usage patterns.
2. **Training the GAN**: The GAN model is trained to learn the distribution and relationships in the original data.
3. **Synthetic Data Generation**: The trained GAN generates realistic synthetic samples.
4. **Validation**: Statistical checks ensure the generated data aligns closely with the original dataset.
