# Synthetic_Data_Generator
Synthetic Data Generator uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in Python to create synthetic data that mimics real-world datasets while preserving privacy. Trained on app usage data, it generates statistically similar samples for use in data augmentation, privacy-preserving analysis, and simulations.
